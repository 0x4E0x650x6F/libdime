#Programming Style

### Character Encoding

Files should only contain characters that are part of the UTF-8
character set defined by RFC3629. For code which is not implementing
locale-specific functionality only the first 128 characters of UTF-8
shall be used, i.e. the characters in the ASCII character set defined by
RFC20.

### Line Length/Text Width

The maximum length of any one line shall be 80 characters.

#### Exception

String constants may break this rule so that any substring may be
searched for without worrying whether the substring is split across
multiple lines.

#### Example

```C
    void
    usage (void)
    {
        printf("Usage: program [--verbose] [--format] -i <input files> -o <output files>\n");
    }
```

### Tabs and Spaces

Tabs are used for indentation. Spaces are used for alighment.

### Indentation

Each level of indentation shall add one tab to the previous level.

### Column Alignment

Column alignment refers to aligning rows of text on column boundaries.
It is used when describing the formatting of groups
of items like parameter lists or local variables.

### Example

```C
    int      gCount = 0;
    char     *gBuf  = NULL;
    long int gSize  = 0;

    void
    function(
        char   *inBuf,
        size_t inSize,
        char   *outBuf,
        size_t outSize)
    {
        int    i    = 0;
        size_t sIn  = 0;
        size_t sOut = 0;
        char   *tmp = NULL;

        ...
    }
```

### Operator Spacing

Spaces should always be placed on either side of an operator, unless the
operator is the last character in a line.

### Parenthesis

Parenthesis shall be used to explicitly define order of operations
unless all operators share the same order of precedence.

### Files

Each source code file shall consist of the following groups, in this order:

- File comment
-	Header guard
- `#include` statements
- `#define` statements
- `enum`, `struct`, and `union` definitions
- Type declarations
- Function prototypes
- Function definitions

When no order is provided, `#include` statements shall be listed in
alphabetical order and listed in two groups, separated by a blank line:
systems headers and local headers. `#define` statements shall be grouped
according to their use, where each group is preceded by a comment
describing their purpose. Extra comments to further clarify an
individual statement will be placed on their own line immediately
preceding the statement they describe.

### Header Guard

Each header file shall include a header guard to prevent multiple
inclusion.

#### Example

```C
    #ifndef MY_HEADER_H
    #define MY_HEADER_H

    ...

    #endif // MY_HEADER_H
```

Include statements shall have one space between the `#include` and the
header name being included. They shall be placed in two groups,
separated by a blank line: system headers and local header. When
possible, they should be sorted alphabetically.

#### Example

```C
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <sys/stat.h>

    #include "common.h"
    #include "sorting.h"
```

### Define statements

Define statements shall have on space between the `#define` and the
identifier. The identifier and replacement-list shall be column
aligned. For replacement-lists which only consist of a single char,
integer, or float value, the replacement-list shall be enclosed in
parenthesis. For replacement-lists which span multiple lines, align the
`\`s at the column after one space is added to the longest line in the
replacement-list.

#### Example

```C
    #define MAX_SIZE       (256)
    #define MODULE_NAME    "stdio"
    #define PRINT_ARRAY(x) do                                               \
                           {                                                \
                               int i = 0;                                   \
                               for (i = 0; i < sizeof(x)/sizeof(x[0]); i++) \
                               {                                            \
                                   printf("%s\n", x[i]);                    \
                               }                                            \
                           } while (0)
```

### Enumeration, Structure, and Union Definitions

All enumerations, structures, and unions shall be defined with file or
global scope and shall use the `typedef` storage specifier. The
`typedef`, `enum` or `struct` or `union`, and tag shall be placed on the
same line, with the opening brace on the following line. Members and
enumeration constants shall be listed on their own lines, one
indentation level in from the enum/structure/union braces. Member types
and names shall be column aligned in structures and unions, while
enumeration constant names, equals signs, and their values shall be
column aligned and include a comma after the last enumeration constant.

#### Example

```C
    typedef struct myStruct
    {
        unsigned int    member1;
        long            member2;
    } MyStruct;

    typedef union myUnion
    {
        unsigned long   member1;
        unsigned char   member2;
    } myUnion;

    typedef enum color
    {
        BLUE    = 1,
        GREEN   = 2,
        RED     = 3,
    } Color;
```

### C99 Integer types

Prefer the **C99** types, defined in `<stdint.h>`

    int8_t | signed 8-bit
    uint8_t | unsigned 8-bit
    int16_t |  signed 16-bit
    uint16_t | unsigned 16-bit
    int32_t | signed 32-bit
    uint32_t | unsigned 32-bit
    int64_t | signed 64-bit
    uint64_t | unsigned 64-bit


### Variable Declarations

A variable declaration shall consist of the following, in order and
separated by a single space:

The storage-class specifier shall be stated, one of:

-   `auto`
-   `extern`
-   `register`
-   `static`
-   `typedef`

If auto storage-class specifier is optional.

The optional qualification is one of:

-   `const`
-   `const volatile`
-   `volatile`

The type specifier shall prefer C99-style integer types (uint64_t etc.).

`char` and an implied `int` shall not be used.

The storage-class, qualification, and type specifier will collectively
be referred to as a variableâ€™s type.

#### Example

```C
    extern long size;

    typedef struct memoryBlock
    {
        unsigned int size;
        signed long  length;
        void         *data;
    } MemoryBlock;

    typedef enum
    {
        BLUE  = 1,
        GREEN = 2,
        RED   = 3,
    } Color;

    void
    function(void)
    {
        unsigned char         c           = 0;
        short                 s           = 0;
        register unsigned int i           = 0;
        signed long int       l           = 0L;
        static const float    f           = 0.0F;
        volatile double       d           = 0.0F;
        static long double    ld          = 0.0F;
        unsigned char         *pC         = NULL;
        unsigned int          aScores[10] = { 0 };

        ...
    }
```

### Function Definitions and Prototypes

A function prototype or definition shall not be indented, excluding the
parameter list as decribed below. It shall be formatted such that the
return type is placed first, then the function name on a new line, and
then the parameters. One space shall separate the function name from the opening parenthesis 
of the parameter list. Parameters shall go on the same line
as the function name unless they will extend past the text width or
there are more than three parameters. In these two cases the opening
parenthesis of the parameter list shall go on the same line as the
function name and the parameter list shall begin on the following line.
The parameter list shall be indented by one tab and have the parameter
types and names column aligned. Parameters which fit on the same line
as the function name shall have 1 space following each `,` character
which separates the parameters. If a function takes no parameters then
use `void` as the parameter list.

Function braces shall be placed as follows.
The opening brace shall be placed one line after the parameter list closing parenthesis, at
the same indentation level as the function declaration. 
The closing function brace shall be placed one line after the last
statement in the function, at the same indentation level as the function declaration.

#### Example

```C
/**
 * @brief	Set the domain name and reverse lookup status of a connection.
 * @note	Possible values for status include REVERSE_ERROR, REVERSE_EMPTY, REVERSE_PENDING, and REVERSE_COMPLETE.
 * @param	domain	the new value of the connection's hostname.
 * @param	status	the new value of the connection's reverse lookup status.
 * @return	This function returns no value.
 */
void
con_reverse_domain (connection_t *con, stringer_t *domain, int_t status) 
{

	mutex_lock(&(con->lock));
	con->network.reverse.status = status;
	con->network.reverse.domain = domain;
	mutex_unlock(&(con->lock));

	return;
}
```

### Global Variables

Global variables shall have no indentation and will use a single space
to separate the type, name, equals sign, and the initialization value.
If multiple global variables exist in the same file then the variable
types, names, equals signs, and initialization values shall be column
aligned.

### Local Variables

Local function variables shall be placed one indentation level in
from the function declaration. The variable types, names, equals signs, and
initilization values shall be column aligned. If only one local
variable exists then a single space may be used to separate the variable
type, variable name, and equals sign.

All types shall be initialized to a meaningful value. If no meaningful value exists yet
then they shall be initialized according to the following rules. 
* integer types shall be initialized to `0` and `0L` for `long` types
* floating types shall be initialized to `0.0F`
* char types shall be initialized to `0`
* pointer types shall be initialized to `NULL`
* all array types shall be initialized to `{ 0 }`
* enumeration types shall be initialized to `0`
* structure types and union types shall be uninitialized

Array initialization lists shall include a space after
the opening brace, after each comma, and a space before the closing
brace. If an initialization list extends past the text width then it
shall be broken into segments of 5 elements per line, with the first
five being listed on the same line as the variable name and each
following line of elements aligned with the elements above it.

#### Example

```C
/**
 * @brief	Get a cached copy of a static web page.
 * @param	location	a pointer to a managed string containing the location of the requested resource.
 * @return	NULL on failure, or a pointer to an http content object with the contents of the requested resource on success.
 */
http_content_t *
http_get_static (stringer_t *location)
{
	multi_t key = { .type = M_TYPE_STRINGER, .val.st = location };

	if (!content.pages) {
		return NULL;
	}

	return inx_find(content.pages, key);
}

```

### Pointers

Pointers shall never have a space between the `*` or `&` and the
variable name, even during declaration/definition.

#### Example

```C
    int
    function(void)
    {
        char    *buf    = NULL;
        char    c       = 0;
        char    *tmp    = NULL;

        ...

        c = *buf;
        tmp = &c;

        ...
    }
```

### Function Calls

A function call shall be placed at the current indentation level 
one line with all arguments separated by a comma and a single
space. If the argumnts extend past the text width, the first
shall go on the function invocation line and all following arguments shall be placed on
their own lines and indented one tab from the function invacation. The terminating
parenthesis and semi-colon shall be placed on the same line and
immediately after the final argument. When parameters are spread across
multiple lines, no space shall follow the separating comma.

#### Example

```C
    int
    function(void)
    {
        ...

        otherFunction(var1, 5, NULL);

        var2 = thisFunction(buf,
            bufLen,
            outBuf,
            outLen);

        reallyLongFunctionName(superLongParameterName1,
            superLongParameterName2,
            superLongParameterName3);

        ...
    }
```

### If, Else If, and Else Statements

If statements shall have a space separating the `if` and the opening
parenthesis of the conditional statement. Braces shall always be used to
contain the statements being executed for the condition, even if only
one statement exists.  The conditional
statement shall not have space between itself and the encapsulating
parenthesis. If a constant is used in the comparison then it shall be
placed on the left side of the comparison.

When multiple conditional statements are used, the first will go on the
same line as the `if`, with all following conditional statements on
their own lines following the first and aligned with the first
conditional statement. Each conditional statement will be encapsulated
in a set of parenthesis. The operators which link separate conditional
statements will be placed at the end of the line, with one space
separating the closing parenthesis of the conditional statement and the
logical operator. If conditional statements need to be nested (e.g.
(arg1 && arg2) || (arg3 && arg4)) then each distinct group shall be
formatted as described above with the operator comparing the two groups
going on its own line. Conditional statements shall only be nested once.

`else if` and `else` statements shall be placed on their own line at the
same indentation level as the `if` statement which they follow.

#### Example

```C
bool_t 
chr_punctuation (uchr_t c) 
{
	if ((c >= '!' && c <= '/') || 
      (c >= ':' && c <= '@') || 
      (c >= '[' && c <= '`') || 
      (c >= '{' && c <= '~')) {
		return true;
	}

	return false;
}
```

### Switch Statements

Switch statements shall have a space separating the `switch` and the
opening parenthesis which encloses the object being switched on. Braces
enclosing the case statements shall be placed on their own lines at the
same indentation level as the `switch`. The `case`s shall be placed on
their own lines and aligned at the same indentation level as the
`switch` with no space between the constant-expression and the colon.
The statements being executed for the space shall be indented by one
level. Braces shall not be used to contain the statements to be executed
for a given case. The default case shall be listed last and contain a
break statement. Whenever the same set of statements is to be executed
for multiple cases, each case shall be placed on its own line with a
comment of the form, `/* Fallthrough */`, placed on its own line
immediately preceding the first case in the group. Cases shall be listed
in alphanumeric order when possible.

### Example

```C
    int 
    function (void) 
    {
        ...

        switch (input) {
        case 'a':
            options |= OPTION_ALL;
            break;
        case 'r':
            options |= OPTION_RECURSIVE;
            break;
        case 'V':    // fallthrough
        case 'v':
            options |= OPTION_VERBOSE;
            break;
        case default:
            break;
        }

        ...
    }
```

### Loop Statements

For loops shall have a space separating the `for` and the opening
parenthesis of the control expressions. Control statements shall have a
space after each semi-colon and no space between the expressions and
their enclosing parenthesis. If the control expressions extend beyond
the text-width then each expression shall be placed on its own line,
except for the first which shall be placed on the same line as the
`for`. The separating semi-colons shall be placed on the same line as
the control expressions which they terminate. If multiple statements
exist in a single control expression, a space shall follow the comma
which separates them. Braces containing the iteration statements are
required and shall be placed on their own lines at the same indentation
level at the `for`.

Do-while loops shall have the `do` placed on its own line and braces,
which are required, shall have the opening brace placed on its own line
immediately following the `do`. The terminating brace shall be placed on
the line immediately following the last iteration statement. The `while`
will be placed on the same line as the terminating brace with a single
space on either side of the `while` keyword, followed by the control
statement placed in parenthesis and finally the semi-colon terminating
the do-while loop.

While loops shall have a space between the `while` and the opening
parenthesis of the control expression. The opening brace shall be placed
on its own line immediately following the line containing the `while`
and be placed at the same indentation level of the `while`. The closing
brace shall be placed on its own line immediately following the last
iteration statement.

Iteration statements shall be placed at one indentation level in from
the loop statement. Control statements for do-while and while loops
should be formatted the same way as `if` statements.

#### Example

```C
    int 
    function (void) 
    {
        for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            ...
        }

        do {
            ...
        } while (i < 5);

        while (i < 5) {
            ...
        }

        ...
    }
```

### Return Statements

Functions shall have a single return
statement. The return value shall not be wrapped in parenthesis unless
the return value is not a constant expression or variable.

#### Example

```c
uint32_t 
pool_get_timeout (pool_t *pool) 
{
	if (!pool)
		return 0;

	return pool->timeout;
}
```

### Goto and Label Statements

`goto`s and `label`s shall not be used.

### Preprocessor Directives

Preprocessor directives shall not be indented and their contents shall
be indented according to the code that precedes it. Nested preprocessor
directives shall indent by one level for each nesting. Each `#endif`
shall include a comment on the same line which specifies which `#if` it
is matched with.

#### Example

```C
    #ifdef WINDOWS
        #define DPRINTF(x)  OutputDebugString(x)
    #else
        #define DPRINTF(x)  perror(x)
    #endif // WINDOWS

    int 
    function (char *buf, int len) 
    {
        if (0 == count) {
    #ifdef WINDOWS
            OutputDebugString(L"Count was 0\n");
    #elif defined LINUX
            perror("Count was 0\n");
    #endif // WINDOWS
        }

        return 0
    }
```
